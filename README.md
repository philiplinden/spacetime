# spacetime

A real(istic) time simulator.

`spacetime` attempts to model time propagation in clocks across the Earth-Moon
system.

Motivated by advancements in space technologies and the increase in lunar
missions, the project advocates for a resilient peer-to-peer design that
accommodates diverse cislunar ecosystems. It focuses on how network topology and
time synchronization evolve in a growing lunar ecosystem, evaluating both
centralized and decentralized Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) service
network configurations. The study aims to predict system performance relative to
interconnected assets and considers interoperability with other missions,
including the definition of a
