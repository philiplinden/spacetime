# spacetime

A real(istic) time simulator.

`spacetime` attempts to model time propagation of clocks across the Earth-Moon system. It focuses on how network
topology and time synchronization evolve in a growing lunar ecosystem, evaluating both centralized and decentralized
Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) service network configurations.
