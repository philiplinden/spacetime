# spacetime

A real(istic) time simulator.

`spacetime` attempts to model time propagation of clocks across the Earth-Moon
system. It focuses on how network topology and time synchronization evolve in a
growing lunar ecosystem, evaluating both centralized and decentralized
Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) service network configurations.

This book serves as documentation for the `spacetime` project and a guide to the
fundamental concepts that it seeks to model.
