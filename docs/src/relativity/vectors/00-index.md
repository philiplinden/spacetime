# Applying Relativity to Vector Math

Now that we've come to grips with the fundamental concepts and intuitions of
relativity, we can start applying these concepts to vector math.

```admonish note
So far we've seen how the speed of light postulate leads to time dilation and
length contraction, but we've only scratched the surface of the implications of
special relativity.

For example, _momentum_ and _energy_. Momentum, $p = mv$, and kinetic energy, $K
= \frac{1}{2}mv^2$, are both conserved quantities in Newtonian mechanics. Pay
close attention and you'll see that both of these quantities depend on the
_velocity_ of the object---relativity will affect these quantities too!

This rabbit hole goes _deep_, eventually leading to the classic $E=mc^2$
equation and more, but we'll only cover the fundamentals and specific
applications of relativity that relate to timekeeping and navigation in deep
space.
