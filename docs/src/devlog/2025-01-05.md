I am going to try using Obsidian to manage the docs. Since I prefer Obsidian's
title-is-the-filename convention, I added a new preprocessor to automatically
generate a SUMMARY.md file every build and there will be a huge diff.

The conventions I'm using for file names are listed in the readme for the
preprocessor: https://github.com/elmdash/mdbook-fs-summary/blob/main/README.md -- Actually this preprocessor didn't work so well. Last update was years ago too. I think I'll drop the idea of auto-generated summary files for now.

This plugin does look useful for making the docs compatible/friendly with obsidian: https://github.com/dvogt23/mdbook-yml-header By using this plugin I can shamelessly add obsidian front matter.

I've been working on the [fundamentals of relativity](/relativity/00-index.md)
for a while and I'm finally starting to dig in to the applications. I need to
have a firm understanding of [](/relativity/vectors/00-index.md) so I can implement it in the app.

I've split the docs into two sections: _Intuition_ and _Application_. The
_Intuition_ section is for the fundamental concepts of relativity. The
_Application_ section is for the hard math and implementation details.

I have a pretty good idea of what I want the app to look like. Short version is
- I want to be able to select a reference frame and inspect the observed time of
other objects. 
- I also want to visualize gravity and the curvature of spacetime like the
  visualizations here: https://youtu.be/wrwgIjBUYVc?si=b-SFIhcVsm5MMwco
- A more advanced version would be to ray-trace signal paths through spacetime and
  perhaps show length contraction.
- I want to use exaggerated scale factors to demonstrate the effects and make
  the math simpler. Things like the speed of light, gravitational constant,
  etc.

I think the visualizations will probably use a shader. I found a good resource
for learning shaders here: https://thebookofshaders.com/
