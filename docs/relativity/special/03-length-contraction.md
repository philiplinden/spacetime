In this chapter I will be using "prime" notation to distinguish elements in the
two frames. The frame at rest has no primes, and the moving frame has primes next
to the variables.

## Length Contraction

From [the previous chapter](./02-time-dilation.md) we know that the dilated
time $t'$ is related to the proper time $t$ by the Lorentz factor $\gamma$.

$$
t' = \gamma t \quad \text{where} \quad \gamma = 1/\sqrt{1
-\Big(\frac{v}{c}\Big)^2} \\
$$

Notice how the relationship between $t$ and $t'$ depends on velocity, $v$. The
definition of velocity is the displacement divided by the time, $v = x / t$, so
what if we wanted to solve for the displacement $x$ in terms of $x'$?
