## Length Contraction

The relative speed between two inertial reference frames, $v$, is the same in
both frames. Think about the astronaut and astronomer in the light clock example
from [the previous chapter](./02-time-dilation.md).

- The astronaut observes the astronomer moving at a constant speed, $v$.
- The astronomer observes the astronaut moving at a constant speed, $v$.
- The astronomer observes the elapsed time on the astronaut's clock, $t'$, to be
  dilated by the Lorentz factor, $\gamma$.

Remember the definition of velocity, $v = x / t$. Since we know that the time
interval $t$ is dilated by the Lorentz factor, $\gamma$, then the distance
traveled by the astronaut, $x'$, must also be stretched by $\gamma$ to keep the
velocity constant.


$$
v = x/t, \quad v = x'/t', \quad t = \gamma t' \\
v = \frac{x}{t} = \frac{x'}{t'}, \quad \gamma = t / t' \\
$$
$$
x' = \frac{xt'}{t} = \frac{x}{\gamma}
$$
$$
x' = x \sqrt{1 - \Big(\frac{v}{c}\Big)^2}
$$

For any velocity $v$ less than the speed of light, $c$, the length contraction
factor is less than 1, meaning the length of the object in the moving frame is
shorter than the length of the object in the stationary frame.
