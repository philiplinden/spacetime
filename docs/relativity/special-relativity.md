# Intuitions for Special Relativity

Special Relativity is a theory of space and time that describes how space and
time are affected by motion. It follows the natural consequences of the
constancy of the speed of light in all reference frames. The _special_ in
special relativity refers to the fact that it is a special case of general
relativity: situations when gravity is negligible and objects are moving at
constant speeds.

## The speed of light is constant

The speed of light is constant in all inertial reference frames, regardless of
the motion of the observer or the source of the light. This is a fundamental
postulate of special relativity.

### A matter of perspective

The first key insight is to approach the problem with the understanding that
motion is relative to the _inertial reference frame_ of the _observer_. In any
situation, we can always choose an inertial reference frame in which one object
is at rest and everything else is moving relative to it.

```admonish example
`Ash` is a train conductor, and `Brock` is waiting for the train to arrive at the
station. The train is moving at speed $v$ relative to the station.
`Ash` throws a Pokeball toward `Brock`, and the ball moves at speed $u$ relative
to `Ash`'s hand.
```
**From `Ash`'s perspective:**
- The train is at rest.
- The station is moving towards the train at speed $v$.
- The pokeball is moving away from `Ash` at speed $u$.

**From `Brock`'s perspective:**
- The train is moving towards the station at speed $v$.
- The station is at rest.
- The pokeball is moving towards `Brock` at speed $v+u$.

`Ash` and `Brock` experience the world from their respective inertial reference
frames. Each of their observations are true, and they are all valid.

The second key insight is to understand that the speed of light is constant for
every observer regardless of their motion or the source of the light.

```admonish note
Here we will ignore the effects of light passing through a medium for the sake
of brevity, but know that the physics still holds.
[This video](https://youtu.be/KTzGBJPuJwM?si=YbBgHIcYyOL3UuSA) provides an
excellent intuition about how the speed of light can be constant and also how
light moves "slower" through a medium.

**TLDW**; The speed of light is constant in any medium. The "slower" speed is a
sort of illusion caused by "phase kicks" between the light and the medium.
```

The first postulate of special relativity is that the speed of light is constant
in all inertial reference frames. Let's apply this to our previous example.

```admonish example
`Ash` is a train conductor, and `Brock` is waiting for the train to arrive at the
station. The train is moving at speed $v$ relative to the station.
`Ash` shines a flashlight towards `Brock`, and the light moves at speed $c$.
```

**From `Ash`'s perspective:**
- The train is at rest.
- The station is moving towards the train at speed $v$.
- The light is moving away from `Ash` at speed $c$.

**From `Brock`'s perspective:**
- The train is moving towards the station at speed $v$.
- The station is at rest.
- The light is moving towards `Brock` at speed $c$.

We can even extend this to the inertial frame of the pokeball if `Ash` throws it
while shining the flashlight:
- The pokeball is at rest.
- The station is moving towards the pokeball at speed $v$.
- `Ash` is moving away from the pokeball at speed $u$.
- `Brock` is moving toward the pokeball at speed $v-u$.
- The light is moving past the pokeball at speed $c$.

**Rather than asking "why is the speed of light constant?", we should ask "what
must be true if the speed of light is constant?"**
