# Gravity, Curved Space, & Curved Time

Now let's bring our understanding of relative to the general case where there
could be a gravity well nearby (aka _general_ relativity).

General Relativity is a theory of gravity that describes how gravity affects the
curvature of spacetime. It builds on the principles of Special Relativity,
following the natural consequences of the constancy of the speed of light
further and leading to the emergence of gravity and the idea that space and time
are not independent axes, but rather our reference frames are composed of a
continuous _spacetime_.

## New equations of motion

The traditional equations of motion specify the position, velocity, and
acceleration of an object with respect to time.

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{position\quad} & \vec{s}(t) = \vec{r}_0 + \vec{v}_0t + \frac{1}{2}\vec{a}t^2 \\[0.5em]
\text{velocity\quad} & \dot{\vec{s}}(t) = \vec{v}_0 + \vec{a}t \\[0.5em]
\text{acceleration\quad} & \ddot{\vec{s}}(t) = \vec{a} \\[1em]
\end{align*}
\begin{gathered}
\text{where\quad} & \vec{s} = \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{bmatrix}, \;
\vec{v}_0 = \begin{bmatrix} v_{x0} \\ v_{y0} \\ v_{z0} \end{bmatrix}, \;
\vec{a} = \begin{bmatrix} a_x \\ a_y \\ a_z \end{bmatrix}
\end{gathered}
$$

## Curved spacetime

```admonish warning
This section is a work in progress.

A key insight that will help us later is to understand that this definition
holds true _even if we morph the reference frame_. So on the grid, an object
would still move from point A to point B with respect to the reference frame.
