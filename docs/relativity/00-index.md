# Intuitions for Relativity

This section builds intuitions about relativity and spacetime.

Einstein's _theory of relativity_ describes how space and time are related based
on the logical consequences of two core postulates:

1. The laws of physics are the same in all inertial reference frames.
2. The speed of light is the same in all inertial reference frames and is not
   affected by the speed of its source.

## Demystifying Terms

The term **inertial reference frame** simply refers to a frame of reference where
all objects follow Newtonâ€™s first law of motion:

> Objects at rest remain at rest, and objects in motion remain in motion at a
> constant velocity in a straight line, unless acted upon by an external force.

For example, the inside of a car moving along a road at constant velocity and the
inside of a stationary house are inertial reference frames.

The _special_ in special relativity refers to the fact that it is a special case
of general relativity: situations when objects are moving at constant velocities
in a vacuum. When the theory is extended to follow what happens when objects
accelerate, it is called _general relativity_.

From here on out, we will not worry about distinguishing between special or
general relativity. They describe the same phenomena.

Here we will ignore the effects of light passing through a medium for the sake
of brevity, but know that the physics still holds.
[This video](https://youtu.be/KTzGBJPuJwM?si=YbBgHIcYyOL3UuSA) provides an
excellent intuition about how the speed of light can be constant and also how
light moves "slower" through a medium.

**TLDW**; The "true" speed of light is still constant in any medium. The "slower"
speed is a sort of illusion caused by "phase kicks" between the light and the
medium as electromagnetic waves propagate through the medium.

## Having the right mindset

When learning about relativity, it is important to approach the problem from a
scientific perspective. The only way to learn about the universe is to make
predictions and then test those predictions with measurements.

It is unsatisfying to say "let's just accept that this is true" but, that's part
of the genius behind Einstein's work. Einstein asks "What would happen if this
is actually true?" Then he follows the logic to see the consequences of that
truth and considers what must happen in order for our observations to be
consistent with that truth.

Scientists have used this approach to make predictions about the universe for
centuries. The predictions are then tested with measurements. If the
measurements match the predictions, then we have evidence that suggests the
prediction is true. Why is it true? We don't know. Science cannot answer that
question.

Every test science has invented to test relativity is true has shown that the
observation matches the predictions made from following Einstein's theory. We
have to accept that we don't know why because we can't test which answer might
be correct. It is an unanswerable question right now. Maybe someday there will
be an invention that lets us know more about the universe but right now this is
as far as we get.

## The textbook

OpenStax has multiple textbooks with sections on relativity:

- [College Physics 2e](https://openstax.org/books/college-physics-2e/pages/28-introduction-to-special-relativity)
- [University Physics Volume 3](https://openstax.org/books/university-physics-volume-3/pages/5-introduction)
- [Astronomy 2e](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/24-1-introducing-general-relativity)

In the coming chapters we'll see how relativity affects equations of motion for
events measured between inertial reference frames. The majority of this work is
based on the Relativity chapter in
[OpenStax University Physics Volume 3](https://openstax.org/books/university-physics-volume-3/pages/5-5-the-lorentz-transformation).
We'll be using the same notation and examples as the OpenStax book, but I'll be
adding some additional commentary and examples to help solidify the concepts.
