# Intiutions for General Relativity

General Relativity is a theory of gravity that describes how gravity affects the
curvature of spacetime. It builds on the principles of Special Relativity,
following the natural consequences of the constancy of the speed of light
further and leading to the emergence of gravity and curved spacetime.

The **Equivalence Principle** states that the laws of physics are the same for
all observers in free fall, regardless of their motion or composition. This
means that the effects of gravity are equivalent to the effects of acceleration.

The **Principle of General Covariance** states that the laws of physics are the
same for all observers, regardless of their motion or composition.
