I haven't made any progress on this in too long.
There are so many directions for this project that are crippling its progress.

So what do I want to accomplish here?
- I want to demonstrate real scientific concepts in a visual, interactive, and intuitive way.
- I want to show how clocks drift and synchronize in deep space networks.
- I want to make a sandbox for realistic physics concepts like [powder game](https://dan-ball.jp/en/javagame/dust2/).
- I want to make a sandbox for users to play with concepts related to general relativity, the speed of light, and networking.

So far, the code I've written does not do any of that. I might have to put this on ice for a little while.
