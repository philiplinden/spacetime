I am going to try using Obsidian to manage the docs. Since I prefer Obsidian's
title-is-the-filename convention, I added a new preprocessor to automatically
generate a SUMMARY.md file every build and there will be a huge diff.

The conventions I'm using for file names are listed in the readme for the
preprocessor: https://github.com/elmdash/mdbook-fs-summary/blob/main/README.md -- Actually this preprocessor didn't work so well. Last update was years ago too. I think I'll drop the idea of auto-generated summary files for now.

This plugin does look useful for making the docs compatible/friendly with obsidian: https://github.com/dvogt23/mdbook-yml-header By using this plugin I can shamelessly add obsidian front matter.
