Here are two videos that really helped me find intuitions for the math of
general relativity:

- https://youtu.be/S78h8zQwQe0?si=1ptIvQqqiFlSOqdG

I think it would be helpful to make this app demonstrate these intuitions. Let's
follow the videos' trains of thought and see if we can implement them along the
way. One thing these videos do very well is to build up ideas bit by bit.
Similarly, I think we can build up the app's features bit by bit.

While the math _could_ be implemented with real physical constants, it would be
much easier to see what's happening if we use simple scale factors, especially
if we can change them on the fly.

I've said this before and I'll say it again: I am a huge fan of the "retro
radar" aesthetic. It would be fun to lean into that. Here is a Pinterest board
