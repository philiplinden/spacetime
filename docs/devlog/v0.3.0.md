This video
[series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu7cY2CPiRjVY-VaUZ69bXHZr5QslKbzo)
on relativity is very helpful. I'm going to watch it through a few times and try
to implement some of the examples in code.

I also read [some additional research](docs/research-papers/Meyers_1999_LunarTime.pdf)
on defining a lunar time scale and it looks simple enough to implement. Famous
last words.

I'm going to start simple and try to implement the relativity basics from the
youtube series before getting into the weirdness of lunar time scales and Nyx.

Delete all the things!

I started using Cursor to write the code. It's pretty cool, but I think I need
to get the hang of it. I also need to get used to not having autocomplete. 

This might be useful for later: https://github.com/oscrim/bevy_map_camera

I started simple and implemented a clock that has proper time and coordinate
time. I also added a `SimulationSpeed` resource that can be used to speed up or
slow down the simulation. Right now it can only be observed or adjusted if you
edit it directly in the world inspector debug panel. Turns out this is built-in
to the engine already with `Time<Virtual>`'s `relative_speed` field.

Even now I am still getting hung up on using Bevy and making it look like how I
imagine it to be. I need to just dive in and start making things and not worry
about having it look like the examples in the videos. Otherwise I will never
actually get anything done, and I will never actually learn Rust fundamentals.

I'm going to remove Bevy altogether to coerce myself to stop over-thinking the
design. Text-based UI via logs and the macros built-in to Krabmaga are enough.

Krabmaga is much more straightforward to work with than Bevy, and it compiles
way faster! I feel like I'm actually making progress on something useful.
