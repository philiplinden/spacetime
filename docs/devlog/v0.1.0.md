Making a few decisions that I might regret:

- I‚Äôm sold on using Rust. For that reason, I‚Äôm going to cut back on bloat that was used to beautify documentation from the Python demos.
- Instead of documented Python projects, just use iPy notebooks converted to HTML.
- Move other Python project management fluff to a subdirectory to hide it from the root.

### Notes

The simulation itself should be a ‚Äúserver‚Äù that tracks the data of all entities, or at least the things that we want to measure or are needed to interact.

The UI should be basically a viewport that renders what is happening, but the simulation can be run ‚Äúheadless‚Äù without the UI.

For example, the client will only spawn nearby entities. Spawned entities don't actually hold their physics and such, instead they just display those properties that are tracked by the server plus other fluff.

Spent some time reading through [https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1464288/](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1464288/)
The author accepted my linkedin connection request and message. I should talk to them.

The repo is getting cluttered with my stumblings through Bevy. I would really like to modify the particulars examples to include time dilation.

Right now the script tries to replicate the ring formation example and the ring debris just flies off into space. Ha, turns out that was just because i forgot to add the Particular plugin to the app.

I think I‚Äôm going to play with building an asset server so I can make the central body look like Earth and the ‚Äúdebris‚Äù to look like satellites.

Nevermind. Instead, I will try to simplify the crate so I can explain every element. So I will either delete or re-write every piece so there‚Äôs no plagiarized code.

Eventually I‚Äôll have to deal with the physics scale. It‚Äôs not meant to run at astronomical scales so I‚Äôll want to have some sort of scale factor in there. [Rapier has this built-in](https://docs.rs/bevy_rapier3d/latest/bevy_rapier3d/plugin/struct.RapierPhysicsPlugin.html#method.with_physics_scale), but I‚Äôm not really sure how to use it. It‚Äôs didn‚Äôt seem to do anything when I used the particular physics.

I‚Äôm going to use [pocket solar system](https://particular.rs/demos/pocket-solar-system/) as my base instead of ring formation now that I‚Äôm more familiar with bevy.

I got the pocket solar system working, and reorganized things a little bit.

### Notes

I think I figured out the problem with my time dilation calculations.

Dt/DC = math right? So for every delta tc, math * delta tc happens .

Delta_t = delta_tc * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)

So what If v=0? Delta_t=delta_tc 

But think about our question ‚Äú for every 1 day of my time, how much different is their time?‚Äù

 Gamma = sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) ‚Üí as ve approaches c, gamma approaches zero. This is why ‚Äútime stops ‚Äú at the event horizon where black hole ve = c, and also why time slows down as you approach c. So gamma is always POSITIVE to indicate SLOWER proper time.

We have dilation from gravity expressed in terms of speed (Gamma U) and dilation from speed (Gamma K) both acting on an object. So how do we combine them?

 Let's be extra verbose so we can think in terms of delta_tc with some intuition 

Let's say I'm on earth moving at earth rotation. Compared to some far away coord time my proper time is delta_tc * (gammaU1 + gamma k1)

For a satellite, there's less potential but maybe more speed. U1 > U2, K1 < K2. Satellite proper time is delta_tc * (gammaU2 + gammaK2)

What is the difference between earth time and satellite time?

Diff when earth observes sat = delta_tc * (gammaU1 + gammaK1) - delta_tc * (gammaU2 + gamma K2) 

Diff = delta_tc * (earth relativistic factor - sat relativistic factor)

If sat on ground, diff = 0. If sat relativistic factor > earth, diff is negative (sat has slower time) if sat relativistic factor < earth, diff is positive (sat has faster time)

So the diff per unit tc is (self relativistic factor - other relativistic factor)

But the velocity is relative speed between them.

TDiff per unit c is [sqrt(1-2GM/c^2r_self) + sqrt(1-(vself - vframe)^2/c^2)] - [sqrt(1-2GM/c^2r_other) + sqrt(1-(vother - vframe)^2/c^2)], where vframe is the velocity of self vs reference frame

There is no gamma k for the observer if ref frame is same as observer body frame since Kinematic dilation is calculated relative to speed vs reference frame

If precision is an issue especially with unit conversion,  try to separate order of mag 

Example

1e-12 * 2e8 ‚Üí (1*2) * 10^(-12+8)

### Notes

I think I got distracted. *Understatement of the year.* It‚Äôs time I focus myself on the real task at hand: modeling heterogeneous lunar networks. Forget bevy, nyx, krabmaga, egui, or any of that for now. I should be able to get by with just logging. Pull only the pieces I need, when I need them. For example, if I need to tick a simulation at a regular interval, I can use krabmaga. If I need to visualize something, egui plots are nice but honestly exporting to a CSV is just fine.

I wrote out a blueprint for the model and have not implemented *any* of it yet. Come on.

I stripped out (most of) the boilerplate, so all that remains is a struct to manage the simulation state, and a struct that manages each node‚Äôs state. This is all I should need to have a discrete-time simulation. Every step represents one time step.

Now to create components that belong to a node. I‚Äôll start with timing. Each node has a clock to make observations of the time. It is not perfect, and it has limited precision and drift. First I‚Äôll implement an ideal clock, then give it some Allan variance.

### Notes

I‚Äôm not procrastinating, I swear. Today I want to play with examples and try modding them.

1. I want to mod the `particular` demo so that particles change their color upon colliding. 
    1. Particles stick together when colliding as a rigid body to form a cluster. Angular and translational momentum is conserved.
    2. Under the hood, assemble an undirected graph between all particles in a cluster.
    3. The colliding particles should assume the color of the larger particle. If equally sized, assume the color of the particle with a higher rank in the graph of connected particles. If still equal, randomly choose one of the particles to use for color reference.
2. Mod the `virus on network` krabmaga example to demonstrate emergent NTP stratified hierarchy.
    1. Designate one node as the Stratum 0.
    2. Display the stratum of each node using an emoji sprite (use number emojis instead of dots).

That means running your simulation at a target tick rate per second, where usually you want simulations that can run as many ticks as possible per unit time. Unfortunately Bevy's frame rate control API is still kinda half baked.

- Created a 3D scene with to-scale Earth, Luna, and a satellite in Bevy
- Found and fixed a few bugs in my assets: https://github.com/philiplinden/clocss-abm/pull/7
- Got comfortable with Bevy enough to know why it's not time to use it.

### Notes

I‚Äôm following this excellent ‚Äú[bevy basics in 0.12](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2wAo2qwCxGDp9fzBOTy_kpUTSwM1iWWd&si=3KgXoqxvKC7pyWe3)‚Äù. There are a few issues related to just adapting the downloaded assets to how I expect them to be, like the coordinate frames.

I‚Äôm running into some basic 3D modeling snags, like the coordinate frames and scales of the models not being consistent. I‚Äôll deal with this eventually‚Ä¶ https://github.com/philiplinden/clocss-abm/issues/4

I‚Äôm a visual person, so I feel like I *need* something on-screen to tell me if things are working.

- Camera coordinates:¬†`0.0, 1.0E5, 1.0E9`
- Satellite coordinates:¬†`0.0, 1.0E5, 0.999999E9`¬†(right in front of the camera)
- Earth coordinates:¬†`0,0,0`
- Luna coordinates:¬†`384_400.0E3, 0.0, 0.0`

Bevy isn't ready for astronomical scales unless we scale it. That and Bevy was making compile times way too bloated. I'm glad I played with Bevy enough to understand what's happening, but it's not the time to mess with it. 

krABMaga is also an ECS framework so the high level concepts still apply. It was nice to learn from Bevy because there is such a rich ecosystem of documentation and plugins to lean on.

If I need spatial behavior, let's keep it small and mimic the Flockers or ant farm examples to attach the clock and radio components to. For fun we can use a Rover model so it doesn't look funny.

I'm saying this for the nth time but I need to step away from the spatial physics.

- [Concepting Round 2](https://www.notion.so/Concepting-Round-2-0dff267748d84dce870ead2bc976885e?pvs=21)
- Found nice open source typefaces.
- Implemented some hello world Bevy scenes, more or less from scratch.

### Notes

Here‚Äôs where the chat started:

[https://chat.openai.com/share/570a9388-9cae-42c9-95a2-23bb2a7021b6](https://chat.openai.com/share/570a9388-9cae-42c9-95a2-23bb2a7021b6)

Turns out ChatGPT doesn‚Äôt know Bevy very well. None of its code compiled. It‚Äôs a useful reference, but not a cheat code.

I found some great open-sourced typefaces and added them to the repo.

Got an FPS counter working from [an example](https://bevy-cheatbook.github.io/cookbook/print-framerate.html). First UI!

I‚Äôm not using Particular or Nyx (yet?) since it‚Äôs pretty simple to set up a hello world physics scene with [Rapier](https://rapier.rs/docs/user_guides/bevy_plugin). I think I might be able to borrow from Particular without actually implementing its higher level functions. I have a feeling I‚Äôll end up kit-bashing my own physics engine from Nyx, Particular, and Rapier.

Took 8 hours but I have a Rust prototype that compiles and renders a scene, interactive camera, and fps counter. Plus GitHub actions to build and test with cargo. üòé https://github.com/philiplinden/clocss-abm/pull/3

### Notes

I'm spinning my wheels worrying about orbits. I have two physics engines that can handle that (particular and nyx). But there are more problems I have to figure out:

1. When does a node try to sync it's clock?
2. How does PTP work?
3. Given two stationary nodes, can I model a network of time appliances?
4. Can I model Doppler shifted radio signals?
5. Does nyx account for time dilation in different gravity wells and speeds or is the epoch always the "god observer" epoch, not a spacecraft's observed epoch? No
6. Could I model time dilation? [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280875893_Simulating_Dynamic_Time_Dilation_in_Relativistic_Virtual_Environment](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280875893_Simulating_Dynamic_Time_Dilation_in_Relativistic_Virtual_Environment)

I have a good feeling about [NICT](https://www.notion.so/NICT-ac822a3863c9459e848f253d3afb3500?pvs=21) as a possible partner on the STP project! üîú

Unfortunately I don't think I'll be able to use particular or nyx as ‚Äúbatteries included‚Äù like they were intended. I worry that particular won't work in 3D, and I worry that I won't be able to run nyx as the physics engine. I'll have to get clever. For now, I‚Äôll stick to 2d with particular until I get the agents going. Fake physics to demo the behavior, like Kerbal Space Program is to the real solar system.

üéØ **Objective:** Dig in with rust.

</aside>

### Summary

- Started coding in rust.
- Refined the [Model Requirements](https://www.notion.so/Model-Requirements-74931747ff9840968d259126634d3fd5?pvs=21).
- Decided to keep working on a Nyx visualization as a Rust warm-up.
- Changed my mind about Nyx as a warm up.
- Moved some things from the requirements doc to [Concepting Round 1](https://www.notion.so/Concepting-Round-1-bc3f8aad11cb4826abf9229bba0341b4?pvs=21)

### Notes

At first I thought it would be relatively easy to wedge ABM agents into an n-body space at let them run wild. The problem is that krABMaga and particular both define physics and simulation updates, so it‚Äôs not obvious whether I should put a krabmaga agent in a particular nbody space, or if I should hack the nbody physics into a krabmaga example.

One drawback to krabmaga is that the crate only ships with 2D or network spaces, no 3D spaces. That said, I think I can use the implementations and traits of the 2D space to make it 3D (with the nyx physics backend) and then mix the network space on top, like an overlaid space.

I‚Äôm still going to try to mix nbody physics with one of the krabamaga examples. I‚Äôm thinking [ants foraging](https://github.com/krABMaga/examples/tree/main/antsforaging) in space would be fun to watch.

On second thought, I‚Äôm going to focus on implementing Nyx types and physics in the krabmaga framework. I think that will save time later because I‚Äôll do less rewriting, but still move me forward. Besides, most of the traits of my agents assumes theyre in space right? 

Hm, if I‚Äôm just using Nyx for physics and making a bevy viewport, that‚Äôs just a Nyx visualization. I guess with [Model Requirements](https://www.notion.so/Model-Requirements-74931747ff9840968d259126634d3fd5?pvs=21) written up it would help to start the visualization to think things through and learn Rust, basically as a warmup.

I‚Äôm too green to learn by modifying an example. I need to build something from scratch in order to learn. I‚Äôm going to try to recreate the particular demo *from scratch* so I know what‚Äôs going on. Then, when my version is shitty and barely works, I‚Äôll go back to the example and shim in my ideas.

This video really hits home, by the way. 

[https://youtu.be/OoJsPvmFixU?list=TLPQMDMxMjIwMjMCT2AN_8zlkQ](https://youtu.be/OoJsPvmFixU?list=TLPQMDMxMjIwMjMCT2AN_8zlkQ)

So starting from the bottom, I need to define an Agent, and a Field for it to live in or move around in. Right now there‚Äôs only ‚Äúbatteries included‚Äù for 2D fields and/or networks. I might need to implement my own ‚Äúspace‚Äù by applying the `Field` trait to the nyx orbit space.

I really like the macros that krabmaga provides with respect to plotting and logging to the TUI that starts up when the simulation starts. It‚Äôs a little cumbersome but a good source of inspiration.

Nyx‚Äôs focus on LEO and ‚Äúreal‚Äù orbits is really getting in the way. I want to just let the sandbox go. I‚Äôll relax my thinking a bit and chill. I like the idea of making a ‚Äúgame‚Äù that happens to show us what we want. So I think the best approach is to use krABMaga for instrumentation of the system, and to track the state. That‚Äôs what it‚Äôs good at, anyway. I think Particular as a plugin to Bevy is sufficient for the physics for now. I mean yeah nyx would be nice (and accurate) but idk right now i want the behaviors to manifest properly. Hopefully I can build it in a way that lets us swap physics engines easily. That would be nice.

I said I was going to spend more time in the ‚Äúdesign‚Äù phase so I should hold myself to it: [Concepting Round 1](https://www.notion.so/Concepting-Round-1-bc3f8aad11cb4826abf9229bba0341b4?pvs=21) has some diagrams and other things. I‚Äôm trying to apply the ‚Äúentity-component-system‚Äù (ECS) way of thinking to the problem. This is how Bevy works but in general I think it suits the model and ABM too. For example, the only difference between a rover and a satellite is their trajectories, so they would just use different physics traits.

üéØ **Objective:** Oxidize me cap‚Äôn.

</aside>

### Summary

- We‚Äôre doing the model in rust. Yolo.
- The [template](https://github.com/krABMaga/examples/tree/main/template) for krABMaga runs! [https://github.com/philiplinden/clocss-abm/tree/oxidize](https://github.com/philiplinden/clocss-abm/tree/oxidize)

### Notes

I had a chat with [Christopher Rabotin](https://www.notion.so/Christopher-Rabotin-ae32feb97c5b4aea8c7eb7e5ed561814?pvs=21) about his experience with Nyx and Rust and how it fits in with my goals for this model. The gist is that Rust works really well if you have a clear idea for what you want the system to do, but not well if you‚Äôre exploring how your system will work. Well, I already have like 4 pages of docs on how it should work. Check. The next thing is that we don‚Äôt have a hard time constraint. This benefits me because I want to *learn*. The last thing is that Nyx was built to solve the problem of modeling a link between LRO and CAPSTONE‚Äîthat is the mvp mission profile I‚Äôd want to simulate. We‚Äôre doing it. LFG.

I copied the template project for krABMaga and it compiles and runs. When run without options, it has a really handy TUI, and it spawns a Bevy app if run with `--features visualization`. I added some assets from [Rust Resources](https://www.notion.so/Rust-Resources-d7b5974702d74d5d9644f382e479f0c2?pvs=21).

### November 28, 2023

üéØ **Objective:** Make the Python/Rust split clear in the docs; set up a Bevy UI for Nyx.

</aside>

### Summary

- Did yet another docs reorg to separate python code from future rust code.
- Stole some code from another rust example.

### Notes

In preparation for exploring rust, I‚Äôve made the docs more explicit about what is the ‚Äúreal‚Äù model and other demos and learnings.

The next goal is to get the Particular solar system demo using Nyx as a trajectory backend.

- Good news: All of the UI for the particular solar system ui demo is in [one file](https://github.com/Canleskis/particular/blob/main/examples/pocket-solar-system/src/ui.rs).
- Bad news: Holy shit this is hard. Not only is it rust but it‚Äôs *someone else‚Äôs* rust code.

Anyway, I started porting the visualizer to Nyx. So far I just copied over some files from the example. I went through the files and commented most of it pretty well. Maybe Chris can take it from here‚Ä¶ [https://github.com/philiplinden/nyx/tree/bevy/examples/bevy-visualizer](https://github.com/philiplinden/nyx/tree/bevy/examples/bevy-visualizer)

I need to choose how to spend my time. Do I try to make a visualization for nyx and contribute to the project? If I do, that‚Äôs a huge distraction from the *actual* goal of designing the model. Yes, the visualization would be useful for displaying the model. I‚Äôd need a model for that.

[N-body physics in Rust](https://github.com/Canleskis/particular) with [solar system visualizations](https://particular.rs/demos/pocket-solar-system/) ([source code](https://github.com/Canleskis/particular/tree/main/examples/pocket-solar-system/src)) in Bevy üëÄ¬†I don‚Äôt know the accuracy of the physics modeling so I‚Äôll stick to Nyx for trajectory propagation, but we can absolutely steal the visuals!

üéØ **Objective:** Write requirements for agents and consider Rust vs Python and the trade-offs of each platform for the feasibility study.

</aside>

### Summary

- Started [Model Requirements](https://www.notion.so/Model-Requirements-74931747ff9840968d259126634d3fd5?pvs=21).
- Spent a lot of time learning Rust fundamentals.
- Decided to dabble in Rust this week to feel it out.

### Notes

Before I decide to go an (re)write everything in Rust I should take a moment to identify the requirements here. This exercise will result in a design doc and double as an exercise in thinking about the problem from first principles. By the end I should be able to decide on what tools to use (Python+Mesa? Julia+Agents.jl? Rust+krABMaga? Rust+Bevy?) from examining the requirements. I‚Äôm not going to try too hard to keep my emotions out of that decision since this project is, for better or worse, fueled by my passion and personal interest.

[Christopher Rabotin](https://www.notion.so/Christopher-Rabotin-ae32feb97c5b4aea8c7eb7e5ed561814?pvs=21) ‚Äòs advice: 

- *My general hunch is that it's probably best to stick with python for as long as you can because you can iterate much faster on the code*
- *I didn't know about krabmaga, now I'm rooting for you to switch to rust especially for the visualization of the constellation*

Ha, turns out krABMaga‚Äôs visualization engine is based on Bevy ([https://github.com/krABMaga/krABMaga#usage](https://github.com/krABMaga/krABMaga#usage)) ‚Üí [conference paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-15-1078-6_2)

### November 25, 2023

üéØ **Objective:** Beautify the website and implement marcopolo detection logic.

</aside>

### Summary

- Tinkered with [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) settings and plugins.
- Created a new `grids` module in `tools` to group functions that deal with hex grids.
- Implemented a very basic ‚Äúdetection‚Äù system.
- Implemented the model for square or hex grids.
- Found a bunch of Rust resources that are very aligned with the needs of this project.

### Notes

The website is actually pretty hard to use as a code reference. I think this is because the default setup is too basic. I‚Äôm going to skim through the theme‚Äôs features and other plugins to make it better.

Material is definitely the best looking and most feature-rich theme for MkDocs. I went crazy with the plugins and settings, but it‚Äôs so worth it.

Now that agent motion is working* the agents should start interacting! (*except for edge cases where forward motion is not possible, I still have to implement that.)

I noticed that much of the `agent` module was just written to deal with the agent existing on a hex grid. This isn‚Äôt inherent to the agent itself (an agent could exist on a square grid, 3d space, or continuous canvas) so I split it into a new `grids` module.

The canvas for hex grids only allows circles or hexagons to represent actors. In order to show heading, I need to have actors either be on a continuous space or a square grid. I spent a good while trying to make the model handle hex or square. It sort of works. Hex works like normal, but when using a square grid the sprites look like they‚Äôre teleporting. I can‚Äôt tell if this is a rendering issue or an actual translation issue.

The detection system isn‚Äôt so bad except it is brute force all the way. I need to add some request-like functions to the model so an agent can ask for a list of other agents within a certain radius, or ask just for the agents of a certain role. Right now it‚Äôs like O(N^2).

Took me a bit to get the ‚Äútagging‚Äù working too. I‚Äôm too tired to figure out what was confusing me about it. It works now, so I‚Äôll call that a win.

I'm seeing some flaws in the ABM framework already. Game engines are essentially ABMs and Bevy is an engine built in rust, so maybe it could integrate with Hifitime and Nyx. Game engines usually have raycasting built in and I think I'm going to be raycasting for other agents within view. I don't really care about the rendering tools, but maybe we can model some radio transmission/ reflection effects using light transport mechanics.

[https://youtu.be/TBjmRmjr4JA](https://youtu.be/TBjmRmjr4JA) 

I need to spend some dedicated time doing lower level design work for a single agent and choose a framework that best suits it.

This is essentially the same as making requirements for a single clock component and host. Two for one.
