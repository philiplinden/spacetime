# 2024-08-11

I restructured the repo with a workspace and set up a placeholder
`hifitime_egui` crate. I think this warrants a version tag, so I'll be tagging
the commit before this change as `0.2.0` and continue here as `0.2.1`.

After some tinkering I realized that `hifitime` does not need to be adapted to
`egui` -- it needs to be adapted to `chrono`! Egui uses `chrono` for
time-related things and that crate is widely used. It makes more sense to write
some code to adapt hifitime to chrono. This seems like an obvious translation...
maybe it already exists. 

THe [hifitime docs](https://docs.rs/hifitime) explicitly call out chrono by way
of comparing the two crates, but I don't see any results in the search for any
translations.

`lofitime` is born!

I rounded out `lofitime` traits and even wrote tests!
[#31](https://github.com/philiplinden/spacetime/pull/31)

I'm annoyed that all my builds are marked as "failed" because they don't pass
the cargo formatter. Now is not the time for formatting! I removed this test.
