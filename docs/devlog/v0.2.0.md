Well I guess I'm making captain's logs again. I restored the notes from last november thru this february. In the time
between I've been working on adjacent projects in Godot and Bevy. Finally getting back in the groove and ready to try
again here.

I've set up the devlogs (formerly `captains_log`) roughly organized by major milestones in the project, roughly aligned
with git tags. Seems like a reasonable way to break it up to me.

I can't help it, I have to mess with the site theme too. 2 hours gone.
