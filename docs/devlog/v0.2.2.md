I basiically went all-in on RON files to manage entities spawned in. Feels good
so far. I looked up crates that might help manage the huge orders of magnitude
of the phyiscal characteristics of the planets, but it wasn't compiling on
Windoes without extra steps for some dependency and I didn't feel like going
down that rabbit hole tonight. Let's tough it out and see what happens. We don't
really need all that much precision... `f64` should be plenty. I do worry about
things like multiplying masses (`E24` for the Sun) against the gravitational
constant (`E-22` or something). This is where Python fell short.

I'm leaning hard on LLMs (Claude Sonnet 3.5, ChatGPT 4o) to make scaffolding
here. It is very helpful, but LLMs aren't consistent in style and such, so there
is some cleanup to do. Very helpful as a "sketch" -- especially if it compiles.

Aaaaand it bit me. I'm going to keep this setup but with totally fake values to
get the main bits up and running. I should probably use
[`nyx`](https://github.com/nyx-space/nyx/tree/master/examples/04_lro_od) for
high fidelity simulations. I _don't_ need high fidelity simulations to get the
point across. I do need it if I want to make any scientific judgements.

Come on, Phil, don't overthink it!

For some reason the timestamps are printing in UTC no matter what time scale is
native to the Epoch I'm making. This could be a bug somewhere in `lofitime`
because of chrono, or it could be a `hifitime` issue. I'll make a new baby crate
to explore this and eliminate variables from my code.

FOUND IT. The `Epoch`'s display formatter overwrites the timescale to UTC in
hifitime 3.9.0. Thankfully this is fixed in `4.0.0-alpha`.

It wasn't an easy upgrade. The new `hifitime` version broke `lofitime`, and I
ended up basically rewriting it. As usual, it feels better after the second time
around. On one hand, a waste of 3 hours dicking around with the UI; on the other
hand, a useful exercise in writing traits, crates, and general rust.

I talked to Chris R about `lofitime` as an official crate and he was supportive.
I'll remove `lofitime` from this repo and give it one of its own. I'll probably
give it a lame name too so other people know what it is.

I deleted `lofitime` since it's now a separate crate. It only drove the UI
anyway. This means I don't need the workspace setup either. I'm gutting a bunch
of dependencies that I wasn't using. Does that make this... take 3?

Focus. Not a lot of time left before we need a demo.
1. Spool up a _simple_ demo of gravity at work. An example from `particular`
   will do just fine. Two or three bodies, that's it. No controls necessary.
2. Get a shader running that shows the potentials. This will be the basis for
   our shader that shows dilation at any point on the grid.

That should be one day of work, I think. Breathe. Let's go.

I kit-bashed some examples from `particular` and `avian` to finally show n-body
physics the way God intended. Until it explodes. Progress, I guess.

I'll set up something simple that looks like Earth, Moon, and a few satellites.

Getting something that looks like actual orbits is pretty hard, turns out. Not
sure why it's so hard but I spent a few hours here and got nowhere.

I want to use the fundamentals here as the basis for some demos at conferences
coming up, but as it stands I'm no farther along than I was in February.

I want to show:
1. Objects subjected to gravity.
2. Clocks on those objects showing their proper time.
3. The tick rate of the clocks warped by local gravity. (As a bonus, speed).

This should convey that the system is dynamic and it's hard to draw boundaries
around where one time scale starts and another stops.

Another thing I want to show is:
1. Two clocks with nanosecond precision.
2. The wi-wi algorithm measuring distance and delta t by comparing clock
   signals.

It might be easier to validate my calculations if I use real units, but then I'd
want to use `nyx` instead of `particular`. Not a terrible idea... Maybe I should
make this a workspace after all and spin off a bunch of experimental crates
until I converge on something.

I'll merge what I have into `main` and then pick off a new branch to experiment
with nyx.

Maybe instead of spending so much time on the orbits, I should spend more time
on... you know... figuring out the time dilation.

Reference frames matter. A lot. I need to spend some time thinking about the
problem of motion and time from the perspective of "how do we convert between
reference frames". 

- https://orbital-mechanics.space/intro/reference-frames.html
- https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/req/frames.html
- https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/Tutorials/pdf/individual_docs/17_frames_and_coordinate_systems.pdf
- https://nyxspace.com/nyxspace/MathSpec/models/gravity/
- https://nyxspace.com/nyxspace/showcase/04_lro_od/

In this context, the most important reference frames are
1. Earth-centered Inertial (ECI).
2. Moon-centered Inertial.
3. Object-centered Body-fixed (for a given actor).

I really don't want to have to code up my own reference frame transformations.
This seals the deal with using Nyx. I'll apply scale factors to help with
visualizations if I need to.  I don't think there's a place for Particular
anymore. Honestly this might also rule out the necessity for Avian as well.
Since Nyx is a real astrodynamics crate, I'm basically locked into 3D as well.

I put settings, constants, etc. in another RON file for safe keeping.

This video
[series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu7cY2CPiRjVY-VaUZ69bXHZr5QslKbzo)
on relativity is very helpful. I'm going to watch it through a few times and try
to implement some of the examples in code.

I also read [some additional research](docs/research-papers/Meyers_1999_LunarTime.pdf)
on defining a lunar time scale and it looks simple enough to implement. Famous
last words.
