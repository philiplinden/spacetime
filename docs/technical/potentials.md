# potential volumes

_A heightmap, but instead of encoding 3D data to a 2D colormap let's encode a gradient field into a 3D volume of values._

## gravitational potential
_Potential_ is how we represent stored energy in an object "at rest," with our definition of "at rest" basically meaning
kinetic energy is zero. In our case, we're most interested with gravitational potential, i.e. the potential energy of an
object at rest caused by gravity.

All but a lucky few humans have lived their entire lives in a tiny sliver on and around Earth's surface. From the
deepest ocean to the tallest mountain, gravity feels _basically_ the same. But what happens when our object goes far
from Earth, to the Moon or beyond? Does gravity change between here and there? (yes) What even _is_ gravity? (well...)

### newtonian physics
[Newtonian physics tells us](https://openstax.org/books/college-physics-2e/pages/7-3-gravitational-potential-energy)
gravitaional potential ($PE$) is the work done against gravity ($g$), so it's porportional to changes in height ($h$).
This is naive, but it hints at deeper intuitions about gravity.

$$
\Delta PE = mg\Delta h
$$

But for Newton, gravity just... is. Look up the value in a table based on measurements someone went through a great deal
of effort to record. What is it? `9.7803267715 m * s^-2`. Okay, but what IS it? To answer this question, we need a more
detailed description of gravitational potential.
